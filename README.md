The Atheist Experience is a weekly show in Austin, Texas geared at a non-atheist  and atheist audience. The Atheist Experience is produced by the Atheist Community of Austin.<br>
The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals. We define atheism as the lack of belief in gods. This definition also encompasses what most people call agnosticism.<br>
